# Python poll app

Hello all! This is here mostly to have as part of my portfolio and to have fun with my friends.

To use, install main.py, requirements.txt, and ensure you have python installed.
If you're on windows add python to path when installing.

Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' after navigating to your install directory in terminal.

Run the program and use!


This is a prototype/demo that I made for fun, it is meant to be used exactly as intended by people that I trust so don't expect a ton. It is easily broken and simply here as I want the experience and think it's cool.
